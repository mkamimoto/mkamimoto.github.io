		<p>There are many resources available to learn a language. There are books, videos, programs, and schools that provide the tools to become proficient in a foreign language. They can be very expensive. Why should there be a price on knowledge if the <b>secret</b> to learning a language is ones own mind. We should have three clear ideas before starting to learn:</p>
			<ul id="clear_ideas">
			  <li>"It is not easy, but not hard either."</li>
			  <li>"If I focus I can learn."</li>
			  <li>"I will not stop learning halfway."</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p>Have you ever thought about watching a movie in a different language? You might have probably thought you would not understand a single word. Study shows that when watching conversation in a different tounge our mind can obtain much of the conversation. Many children learn their native language that way. So why can't adults learn a foreign language the same way.</p>
		<p>Have you thought about talking to yourself. They say that speaking out loud can help you learn not only grammar but pronunciation as well. Why do you think young children speak alone some times. They are in the process of learning a language.</p>

		<h2>How to Understand a Foreign Language?</h2>
			<p>Throughout life we hear all different languages, dialects and accents. There are moments when we may just understand one single word in a whole sentnce or we understand everything but one word. Yet that one one word is what makes us understand the whole sentence. If you understood everything but that one word you did not undesrtand anything.
